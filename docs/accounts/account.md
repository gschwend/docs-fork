# Accounts

## Getting an account

To access the LIneA environment, you will need a credential that consists of a _username_ and a _password_. :smile:

To get this credential go to _[http://www.linea.gov.br > ServiÃ§os > Registro de Participantes](http://www.linea.gov.br)_ and **_fill the form_**.

Our support team will proceed with the creation of your account, once created you will receive a message with some instructions, including your credential.
