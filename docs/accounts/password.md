# Passwords

## Password and Account Protection

A user is given a username (also known as a login name) and associated password that permits her/him to access LIneA resources. This username/password pair may be used by a single individual only: _passwords must not be shared with any other person_.

Passwords must be changed as soon as possible after exposure or suspected compromise. Exposure of passwords and suspected compromises must immediately be reported to helpdesk@linea.gov.br.

## Forgotten Passwords

If you forget your password send an email to helpdesk@linea.gov.br

## How To Change Your Password

You can easily change your password using the [Self-Service Change Password](https://srvlupa.linea.gov.br/trocasenha/index2.php).
